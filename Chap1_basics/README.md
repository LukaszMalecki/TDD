# Chapter 1 - First solution using Xunit.
The goal of this chapter was to teach basics of unit testing and the TDD approach.

The task was to implement integers division and satisfy a few Acceptance Criteria.

The solution consists of a class library project and a xUnit Test Project.

Some of the subjects discussed in this chapter:
- naming conventions
- xUnit
- SUT (System Under Test)
