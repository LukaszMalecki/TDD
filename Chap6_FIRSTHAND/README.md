# The FIRSTHAND Guidelines of TDD - Chapter 6

The goal of this chapter was to teach about the FIRSTHAND guidelines.

The chapter was composed of theory with a few examples showing how to apply the recommended practices.

Some of the subjects discussed in the chapter:
- FIRSTHAND
	- First
	- Intention
	- Readability
	- Single-Behavior
	- Thoroughness
	- High-Performance
	- Automation
	- No Interdependency
	- Deterministic
- Benefits of starting coding with unit tests
- What unit tests should actually test
- How the intention of a test should be conveyed
- Builder pattern
- What is meant by behavior in the context of FIRSTHAND
- Why we shouldn't have unit tests for internal behavior
- Code coverage
- The cost, time, quality (thoroughness) triangle
- Speed of each type of test and why it's important
- Code being platform-independent
- Why tests should not affect each other
- Why tests should be deterministic and how to achieve that
