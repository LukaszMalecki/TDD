# TDD
Repository containing code and summaries based on the book on TDD

In this repository I share bits of what I learned thanks to the book "Pragmatic Test-Driven Development in C# and .NET" by Adam Tibi, published by Packt Publishing.

Instead of forking their repository:
https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Pragmatic-Test-Driven-Development-in-C-Sharp-and-.NET/tree/main

I recreated each of the projects from scratch, to help me better understand and remember. Also there are small bits that needed updating, such as OpenWeatherMap OneCall 2.5 being discontinued forced be to change code a bit to accomodate for OneCall 3.0.

I find the book very useful and would encourage others to buy it.
