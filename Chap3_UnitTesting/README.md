# Getting Started with Unity Testing - Chapter 3

The goal of this chapter was to teach about Unit Testing using xUnit and some of the practices surrounding this topic.

The task was to add a testing class to our previous project from chapter 2 and write some simple unit tests using advised conventions.

The solution consists of a .net web API app and an xUnit project.

Some of the subjects discussed in the chapter:
- test doubles
- xUnit
- [Fact], [Theory]
- AAA
- naming conventions
- code snippets
- SUT
- no interdependency
- Assert class
- Record class
- SOLID
